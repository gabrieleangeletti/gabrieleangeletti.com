              Hi, I'm <span class="font-semibold text-primary">Gabriele Angeletti</span>. For almost
              a decade now, I've dived deep into the world of software engineering, leading teams
              and architecting complex systems that deliver real-world impact. Currently, I'm building 
              at a startup where I continue to bridge the gap between ambitious visions and tangible reality.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-base-content/80 mt-6">
              My journey has taken me from laying the foundational engineering practices for startups 
              scaling to millions of users, to modernizing critical platforms that support millions 
              in turnover. I thrive on untangling complex technical challenges and crafting software 
              that doesn't just work, but truly excels.

              I believe we are shaped by the problems we solve and the people who inspire us. 
              This site serves as my personal laboratory—a space to document the systems I build 
              and the miles I run. My current focus outside of professional work includes:
