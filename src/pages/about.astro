              Hi, I'm <span class="font-semibold text-primary">Gabriele Angeletti</span>. For almost
              a decade now, I've dived deep into the world of software engineering, leading teams
              and architecting complex systems that deliver real-world impact. My journey has taken
              me from laying the foundational engineering practices for startups scaling to over a
              million users, to modernizing critical platforms that support millions in turnover and
              streamline operations for entire companies.

              My passion lies in crafting robust, intelligent software that doesn't just function,
              but truly excels and moves the needle for your business. I thrive on untangling
              complex technical challenges.
