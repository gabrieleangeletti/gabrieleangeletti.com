import ConwaysGameOfLife from "../../components/ConwaysGameOfLife";

Being new to Astro, I wanted to get an understanding of how [Astro islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) work. I also thought it'd be a chance to test some vibe coding. Below is a vibe-coded implementation of [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Here is the [code](https://github.com/gabrieleangeletti/gabrieleangeletti.com/blob/main/src/components/ConwaysGameOfLife.tsx).

Here is the initial prompt (I used Claude 4 Sonnet with Thinking mode):

```
I want you to implement Conway's Game of Life.

It should live inside a blog post in `src/content/blog/vibe-coding-conways-game-of-life.mdx`.
Implement the actual logic in a React component, which is rendered inside the `.mdx` blog post.
Please use Three.js for the implementation.
Since this is the first time we include React components into blog posts,
you should figure out how to accomplish this using Astro's best practices.

Feel free to factor out common/utility logic somewhere else if you see fit.

If you need anything from me, please interrupt what you're doing and come ask me any question.

Curious to see what you build!
```

It got the game's logic at the first attempt. But all I saw on the page was a black canvas. It took four follow-up prompts to get to the bottom of the issue.

For the first two follow-ups, it went in a completely wrong direction. In the third follow-up, I directed the model in the right direction, with a simple: `Should we try testing a simple React counter component to see if it's the .mdx <-> .tsx integration somehow?`.

With this, it understood we were missing the `client:load` directive, effectively creating an [Astro Client Island](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/#client-islands). By default, Astro strips out all client-side JavaScript automatically. That's why all I was seeing was a black canvas.

But this was not the whole story. After another follow-up prompt specifying that I deploy my website as a statically generated site, we got to the latest problematic bit - removing the `.tsx` extension from the import statement in the `.mdx` file to enable static bundling. `import ConwaysGameOfLife from '../../components/ConwaysGameOfLife.tsx';` gets treated as a dynamic import, while `import ConwaysGameOfLife from '../../components/ConwaysGameOfLife';` kicks off module resolution, thereby including the file in the main bundle.

Lesson learned: include your deployment strategy in the prompt, as that can direct the model towards one approach or another one.

As for the missing `client:load` - We are adding an interactive component to an otherwise static page. This is exactly what Astro's islands are meant for. [Astro's docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/#client-islands) explicitly mention:

> By default, Astro will automatically render every UI component to just HTML & CSS, stripping out all client-side JavaScript automatically.

I would have expected Claude to pick this up.

Anyways, this was a fun experiment. I've learned more about how Astro works, and in the process learned a thing or two around prompt engineering. You can scroll down to see Claude's creation.

## The Magic Behind the Scenes

This implementation uses Three.js to render each cell as a 3D cube. Live cells glow with a soft green light, while dead cells appear as faint gray shadows. The orthographic camera gives us a clean, top-down view that still shows the 3D depth.

Here's what makes this version special:

- **Real-time 3D rendering** with proper lighting and shadows
- **Smooth animations** running at 60fps
- **Interactive controls** - play, pause, step through generations, or reset
- **Customizable parameters** - grid size, cell density, and animation speed

## The Technical Bits

The implementation combines React hooks for state management with Three.js for rendering:

- `useRef` hooks manage the Three.js scene, camera, and renderer
- `useEffect` handles the game loop and updates the visual representation
- `useCallback` optimizes the game logic functions
- Material switching creates the visual difference between alive and dead cells

The game logic itself is straightforward - for each cell, count its neighbors and apply the rules. The tricky part is managing the React-Three.js lifecycle, ensuring proper cleanup when the component unmounts.

## Why This Matters

Conway's Game of Life isn't just a pretty toy (though it certainly is that). It's a powerful example of how simple rules can create complex emergent behavior. It's been used to explore concepts in:

- **Artificial life** and emergence
- **Complexity theory** and self-organization
- **Computer science** and cellular automata
- **Philosophy** of computation and life itself

John Conway himself called it a "zero-player game" - once you set the initial conditions, the system evolves entirely on its own. There's something profound about watching these patterns emerge from nothing but mathematical rules.

## Play and Explore

Try clicking the reset button a few times to see different starting patterns. Some will quickly stabilize into static structures or simple oscillators. Others might surprise you with complex, long-lived patterns that seem to have a life of their own.

Watch for:

- **Gliders** - small patterns that move across the grid
- **Oscillators** - patterns that repeat with a fixed period
- **Still lifes** - stable patterns that never change
- **Chaotic regions** - areas where the pattern keeps changing

The beauty is that you never know what you'll get. Each random starting configuration is like rolling cosmic diceâ€”most patterns die out quickly, but sometimes you'll discover something wonderful.

_Happy pattern watching!_ ðŸŽ®âœ¨
