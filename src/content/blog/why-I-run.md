I used to think running was my escape.<br>
But it’s not.<br>
Running is my way of life — a way to meet it head-on, one step at a time.<br><br>

It’s always come naturally to me. I’ve never had to stop and ask, “Why do I run?”
It’s just what you do. Period. We don’t question why we breathe, or drink water, or sleep. For me, running sits at that same table. Still, lately I’ve been wondering — why is it such an important part of my life?
<br><br>

Here's my attempt at an answer. Maybe it’ll change. But this is how I feel about it today.
<br><br>

- I run because I have to.
- I run because it quiets the voices.
- I run because when my legs are racing, my mind is not.
- I run because my body craves the movement.
- I run because it feels like I’m going somewhere.
- I run because the exhaustion unblocks my emotions.
- I run because I get to explore the unknown and break limits.
- I run because it’s the most natural way of travelling.
- I run because as humans, we are meant to run.
- I run because running is life.
